                        <h2>Understanding Transformers and Harmonic Distortion</h2>
                        <p>Transformers are fundamental components of the electrical grid, but they are not immune to issues like harmonic distortion. Harmonics, which are currents or voltages with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental power frequency, can be introduced by various sources and have significant negative impacts on transformer performance and lifespan.</p>
                        
                        <div class="feature-image-container">
                            <img src="images/harmonic-distortion-wave.png" alt="Diagram showing harmonic distortion in a power wave" style="max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">
                            <p class="caption">An illustration of a clean sine wave versus one with harmonic distortion.</p>
                        </div>


                        <h3>Sources of Harmonics</h3>
                        <p>Transformers themselves can introduce harmonics due to their nonlinear magnetizing characteristics and load fluctuations. Additionally, external factors and modern electronic loads contribute significantly:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Non-linear Loads:</strong> Devices like computers, battery chargers, variable frequency drives (VFDs), and LED lighting draw non-sinusoidal currents, creating harmonic distortion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grid Events:</strong> Tap-changed transformers, if not properly tuned, can become a source of voltage harmonics. Solar storms can also induce geomagnetic currents (GICs) that lead to extreme harmonic levels.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Damaging Impact of High Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)</h3>
                        <p>Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is a measure of the total harmonic content in a signal. High THD levels are detrimental to transformers and other electrical equipment, leading to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Increased Losses:</strong> Higher iron and copper losses, reducing the transformer's efficiency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduced Capacity and Lifespan:</strong> The additional heat generated by harmonics shortens the life of the transformer and reduces its load-carrying capacity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overheating and Failure:</strong> In severe cases, high THD can cause transformers to overheat and fail catastrophically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <hr>

                        <h2>The Ting Sensor Network: A Smart Grid Solution</h2>
                        <p>Whisker Labs' Ting Sensor Network provides an unprecedented, high-resolution view of the power grid. With over a million sensors deployed across the U.S., the network offers granular insights into power quality, helping to identify and mitigate issues like harmonic distortion.</p>

                        <h3>How Ting Works</h3>
                        <p>The Ting sensors are installed in homes and businesses and are designed to differentiate between local electrical issues and grid-wide phenomena. By correlating data from multiple sensors, the network can pinpoint the source of power quality problems with remarkable accuracy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Granular Data:</strong> The network monitors THD, voltage, and frequency at a local level, revealing hotspots that national-level monitoring would miss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Localized Insights:</strong> Data from the Ting network has shown that THD levels can vary significantly even within the same city, highlighting the need for localized monitoring and solutions.</li>
                        </ul>
